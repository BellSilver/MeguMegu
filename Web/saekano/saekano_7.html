<p>&emsp;Eriri waiting for Tomoya outside his house and the two going to school together like good childhood friends do. Tomoya's happy that they've patched up their relationship, but he can't shake off the strangeness of walking to school with her. It's alright, he tells himself. On the train, Tomoya reflects on the success of their game Cherry Blessing, which has been well-received and sold like hot cakes in stores. He highlights Eriri's instrumental role in popularizing their game. After all, she's the talented illustrator known as Eri Kashiwagi and it'd have been strange if her artistic evolution did not generate buzz. He asks Eriri about her progress on the cover art of their game, as she has promised to do a new one for the next batch of store releases. Eriri doesn't give him a straight answer but tells him to believe in her and wait a little longer.</p>
<div id="div2"><a href="Illust_v07/Saekano_07_01.jpg"><img id="div2" src="Illust_v07/Saekano_07_01.jpg"></a></div>
<p>&emsp;On the way, they run into a waiting Utaha who greets them and jokes about how it's another cold day outside the 5-metre radius of the pair. Eriri complains in a low voice about Utaha purposely being a nuisance. Tomoya says it's unusual for Utaha to be waiting for them and she replies that as she will be leaving soon, she'd like to once more carve some precious memories of her and Tomoya on the road that they have shared for the past three years. Eriri murmurs that up until now Utaha has never gone to school together with Tomoya. Utaha says Eriri is the same and calls her childish for complaining over such matters. An angry Eriri is ready to strike back but Tomoya asks them to get along since they don't have much time left together.<br> 
Tomoya recalls how he and Utaha first met and thinks about all the important contributions she's done to make their game so popular. After all, she's the brilliant writer known as Utako Kasumi and it'd have been odd if her venture into visual novels and her superb skills did not garner attention. Tomoya tells himself that it's alright for Utaha, who has always attended school alone, to be walking him to school today. Utaha asks Eriri about the new cover art but the latter says she's not obliged to answer Utaha who is only in charge of the script. Utaha casually reminds Eriri that even if they aren't employees working for the same company, they are still members of the same doujin circle and it's disheartening to have an administrative hierarchy like that. Utaha says that sharing good and bad experiences is the charm of being in doujin circles, but Eriri states that Utaha only say things like that when Eriri's in trouble. Tomoya tries to get the girls to stop because everyone else is staring at them. This is not alright, Tomoya thinks as he finds himself ÅEan active kimo-ota who is held in low regard by his schoolmates ÅEsandwiched between the two prettiest girls in their school. Much to his dismay, Eriri tells him to shut up and stay out of her and Utaha's business. Utaha agrees and says Tomoya ought to keep quiet because if he let out his true feelings and protected her here, Eriri may never recover from the despair of losing. Eriri rages and yells at the giggling Utaha, while Tomoya resigns himself to the fact that the two are completely breaking their fa?ades before everyone and there's nothing he can do to stop them. On top of that, he's got his own problems to deal with afterwards thanks to the girls.<br>
Tomoya's classmate Yoshihiko asks him about the incident earlier. Sensing that all the boys in the room are waiting for his response, Tomoya pretends to be calm and says he doesn't want to talk about it, and dissuades Yoshihiko from further pursuing the topic. Ever since he started coming to school and spending time together with Eriri, Tomoya has become a hot topic among the students. He's already used to being bombarded with questions, but hasn't said much since there's little point in telling other people about what happened between him and Eriri.<br>
Megumi gets to the class one minute before the bell rings. Tomoya tries to ask her to attend their group meeting but Megumi excuses herself and goes to her seat. Even though Megumi appears to be her usual self, Tomoya notes that since the beginning of the year, it's as if she's been timing her arrival and departure at the school (to avoid him). Tomoya takes this as a sign of Megumi's rebellion and says it really hurts.</p><hr>
<p>&emsp;On the night of Valentine's Day, Eriri visits Tomoya and gives him a box of whiskey bonbon, which she had with her the whole day but was too shy to give to him in school. Tomoya observes the casually dressed Eriri and notes that she's become a lot girlier lately. Eriri notices that hers are the only chocolates Tomoya's received today and asks him about the other girls. Tomoya says Michiru and Izumi are both busy studying, and Utaha wasn't at school today since the third years are free to attend school prior to their graduation. Though deep down he was kind of looking forward to get chocolates from them today. Eriri asks him about Megumi and sees that things still aren't going well between the two. She says she can get in touch with Megumi about it for him. Tomoya asks her if she's been contacting Megumi and Eriri says they have been talking to each other every day on LINE, but it's mostly small talks. Eriri wonders if Megumi is still upset about the Winter Comiket but Tomoya says that issue has already been resolved, or at least it's not directly related to the reason why Megumi hasn't forgiven him. He tells Eriri to not talk about it for now and Eriri says that's his response every time the topic is brought up. Tomoya tries to change the subject and asks about the new cover art, but Eriri gives a reply similar to his by asking him if they could not talk about it today.<br>
&emsp;The pair end up watching late night anime together. Eriri has told Tomoya that she's in a slump and can't draw anything. He says he can help with ideas for the composition but Eriri reminds him that the rough sketch has already been done. She tells him to wait until the weekends. Tomoya notes that she's been telling him the same thing for the past two weeks. Eriri reassures him and says she feels very fulfilled right now, though her lonely voice betrays her as she leans against Tomoya.<br>
&emsp;Another hour passes as the two childhood friends watch and complain about anime. Eriri shows no sign of leaving and the atmosphere is so cozy that Tomoya thinks no matter how one looks at their current situation, there is no way anyone would think this is something as simple as two otaku friends spending peaceful time together. Eriri suddenly asks him if she has to do a new cover art. She says the original cover art is fine and asks him why they need to change it. Tomoya is startled by her negativity. Eriri says things like changing the cover (repackage versions), adding a mere few kilobytes worth of additional scenarios (renewal versions), or making games with sequel hooks as a business strategy are nothing more than exploiting the fans. Eriri tells Tomoya that their circle have already sold enough copies to break even and that there's no point to sell their game any more. Tomoya says it's not really about the new packaging or money, he just wants more people to play their game. In the end, Tomoya can't bring himself to reproach Eriri for not wanting to draw and believes they can no longer get back the burning passion they had during the Summer Fireworks Festival (chapter 6 of the third volume), because he has experienced the chill of seeing Eriri exhausting herself to meet his expectations. All Tomoya can do is to accept Eriri the way she is right now.</p><hr>
<p>&emsp;In a certain burger shop sometime near the end of February, Tomoya gets his belated chocolates from Utaha who apologizes for not giving them to him on Valentine's Day. Tomoya congratulates her on the release of her latest light novel Pure-Hearted Hectopascaland thanks her for signing his copy. She tells him that he didn't have to line up since she could sign his book at any time, but Tomoya says it's all part of the experience and it'd be impudent of him to call himself a true fan if he took the easy way out. He says impressions of her new book should be popping up online soon. Utaha says she will pretend not to see anything posted so far because impressions right after release tend to be weird. Tomoya agrees and says that there are people who are quick to criticize without finishing the book, and those who would spread disinformation or post spoilers. Utaha says people who post negative comments just to get attention and treat hard-working creators like sacrificial offerings should be wiped off the face of the earth. She notes that Tomoya hasn't updated his blog ÅEa fan site dedicated to her works ÅEfor a while. He says that the new release would be a great chance for him to make a comeback, and gingerly asks her if he could read the book now. Utaha jokingly replies that she can't believe there are men who would prioritize reading books while spending time with women. Tomoya says he's been dying to read it for too long, even if the book being delayed was partly his fault (due to Utaha's involvement in his game). Smiling wryly, Utaha says in that case she will be taking a nap as usual and Tomoya can go ahead. He thanks her and gets into the book.<br>
&emsp;Three hours later Tomoya finishes reading and apologizes to Utaha for neglecting her. She says she's used to neglect play, and points out that he should probably apologize instead to the people in the shop for having all sorts of reactions while reading. Although Utaha's told him that she'd be napping, for the entire 3 hours she just sat there and stared at his face. She wonders if she could see him like this after graduation. Tomoya says he will always come to her book signings, though he knows that they will become further apart as time goes on.<br>
&emsp;On the way back, Utaha asks Tomoya if he's going to her university next year. He says it's definitely impossible for him to get in and he's unsure if he wants to do tertiary studies. Wishing to know what will happen to their circle from now on, he asks her what plans she has once the university starts. With a gloomy face, Utaha inclines her head to Tomoya and says she will probably join a tennis club that goes on group dating instead of playing tennis, and lead an uneventful life of passing out from spiked drinks and being taken to you know where against her will. Just the usual Utaha. Answering more seriously, she says she will continue with her book and devote herself to her writing career if possible. Tomoya asks her about their circle and if she could remain as an official member. She tells him that some big game company has made an offer to her. He says she can just write one route or extra scenarios and asks her if she'd participate in their next game. Utaha knows Eriri's in a slump and asks Tomoya how long he is going to wait around for Eriri to start drawing again. Utaha says what happened at the end of last year couldn't be helped because Eriri was driven into a corner and wasn't in a good shape, but right now she has plenty of time and there are no unavoidable circumstances. If she still can't draw when things are like this, then it'd be impossible to do any creative work at all.<br>
&emsp;Tomoya says he wants to keep the circle going and that's why he doesn't want to push the members too hard when they are troubled. Utaha asks him if he intends to continue messing around with a slack circle that has no goals or fighting spirit. Tomoya says that he's always imposed on the others even though he can't do anything himself. Utaha asks him why he's so overprotective of Eriri and says that while it might make Eriri Sawamura happy, it isn't happiness as far as Eri Kashiwagi's concerned. Utaha confesses that she wants to team up with Eri again and create something that surpasses cherry blessing. Saying that now is just unfair, senpai, Tomoya thinks, I mean, you never told me you're such a big fan of Eri Kashiwagi.<br>
&emsp;Falling snow brings an end to their conversation. Reminded of his falling-out with Utaha a year ago, Tomoya feels as if the past few hours he's spent with her were just a dream and before him lies nothing but a cold hard reality.<br>
</p><hr>
<p>&emsp;In a certain cafe sometime during the last week of February, Tomoya shockingly receives chocolates from Iori, who jokes that Tomoya shouldn't overreact since they used to be best buddies. Iori says the chocolates are really from his sister Izumi, who is too busy with her entrance exam to come in person. Tomoya tells Iori to pass his words of encouragement to Izumi, but gets lectured by the brother on how he should have done that earlier instead of doing it as an afterthought. The boys talk about their games and Iori says their next shipment is expected to reach ten thousand copies. Tomoya is impressed but Iori reveals that their game hasn't actually been well-received. Tomoya asks if Iori's boosting the sales through things like store bonuses, but Iori says people are actually buying his game only because cherry blessing is sold out. Iori says there is still no clear winner between the two as his games has better sale figures while Tomoya's game is better received. He wants to settle the score with a new game in the Summer Comiket, but upon sensing Tomoya's reluctance, Iori asks if the rumour that blessing software is not participating in the next Comiket is true. Surprised that such a rumour even exists, Tomoya says Iori's information network is way too scary.<br>
&emsp;With a pensive look, Iori warns Tomoya about Akane Kousaka, the shrewd founder of Iori's circle and an acclaimed mangaka. Tomoya asks Iori if Akane is returning to their circle. Iori says he can't speak about the details but tells Tomoya that despite what many people think, Akane has no interest in money. He says her interest is in something else. Tomoya asks if Akane is a bit of a weirdo. Iori says that's all he can tell Tomoya and apologizes for being cryptic.<br>
&emsp;Before parting, Iori confirms with Tomoya that the latter will keep blessing software running. Iori says he will be expecting great things and tells Tomoya that he's played cherry blessing. Tomoya thanks Iori but is surprised to learn that Iori has figured out that the decidedly happy-end last route isn't written by Utaha. Iori says that he knows because he's read all the Little Love Rhapsody 2 fan fic that Tomoya used to write to Izumi. STOPSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOOOOOOP!!! Tomoya screams helplessly as Iori digs up his dark history from a distant past.<br>
&emsp;Snow falls again on Tomoya's way home. Stopping at a red light, he notices the family restaurant that he used to work at. Thinking of dropping by to say hello, Tomoya walks towards the restaurant but turns back when he (finally) spots Megumi inside. Since he didn't follow her all the way here like a stalker, Tomoya reckons it's okay to observe Megumi from a safe distance. He sees that she's really alone and notes it's the first time he's looked at her for so long this year. After all, Megumi hasn't been coming to their circle for two months now. Two months would have been enough for Megumi to sort out and rebuild her circle of friends, she could have gone back to a world free of otaku. Alone in the restaurant, Megumi doesn't appear to be doing anything other than just sitting there, occasionally sipping her drink and looking outside the window. More than 6 months, less than a year; more than friends, not quite otaku friends. Tomoya wonders if there's still something left in that kind of relationship he has with Megumi. Wishing to know if he could make up to Megumi somehow, he sends a business-like text message to her, informing her of a meeting with just the two of them on Friday. This is the last chance. If Kato has no reaction to the mail, then there's no hope. She will never come back to blessing software. Tomoya thinks as he continues to watch Megumi, who takes out her phone and reads the message ÅEshowing no clear signs of any emotion.<br>
&emsp;Thirty minutes later, Tomoya decides that the snow, which has since turned into sleet, is getting too much for him and goes home. In the end, Megumi just looked at the message and had no character-defining reactions as Tomoya had hoped. Precisely because of this, Tomoya knows that there's still hope. Megumi didn't laugh, she didn't get angry, nor did she cry; she was as indifferent as she'd always been. Tomoya saw it. For the entire half an hour, Megumi just sat in her seat and stared at Tomoya's message.<br>
&emsp;That night, Tomoya didn't sleep. After reaching home, he booted up cherry blessing and cleared all the routes. He cried as he played through the game. He didn't cry because of the impressive graphics or the breathtaking scenario. He cried because he had finally understood how hard Megumi had worked on the game, and how much she'd improved it. She wasn't just the model for the heroines. The interface, the timing of BGM and the subtle changes in characters' expressions all screamed Megumi. Realizing something important, Tomoya cried, contemplated, and made a final decision as the sun rose.</p><hr>
<p>&emsp;Preoccupied with thoughts the next morning, Tomoya fails to notice that Eriri has gone to school alone until he runs into her at the gate. She talks to him about the cover art and Tomoya tells her not to worry. He says that he will wait until Eriri's ready to draw again. However, Eriri appears to feel uneasy about being a creator. Although she still likes drawing, what happened on Nasu Highlands seem to have damaged her confidence. She asks Tomoya what she should do. Tomoya says he likes her art and he will always follow Eri Kashiwagi. He thinks that with the last seven CGs she's drawn for the game, Eriri has already fulfilled the promise of becoming a better artist than anyone to him. He apologizes and tells her that he can't force her to draw, and that even if it may seem irresponsible of him, Eriri will have to decide for herself. He asks her not to hate otaku if she ever stopped drawing, to which Eriri replies that she won't. Tomoya says then it's fine and thinks that while it's devastating if Eriri gave up on drawing, he doesn't dislike the Eriri who would return to being a consumer otaku. Before leaving for their respective classrooms, the pair encounters Megumi. They awkwardly greet each other and Tomoya asks Megumi if she's read his mail. Noticing that Megumi is a little shaken, Tomoya knows he's onto something.<br>
&emsp;After dinner, Tomoya gets into planning his next game. He regrets what has happened to their last project. Everyone except him gave their all but he did not lead them to their dream goal, because he stopped running at the very end. That's why this time he will do his best and leave no regrets behind. Having experienced the ups and downs of being a creator, Tomoya no longer wants to go back to being a simple consumer. If he can't go back, then all he's got to do is charge ahead to the bitter end. With ideas springing forth from his mind like never before, Tomoya finishes his proposal. Exhausted, he goes to sleep but suddenly gets a new idea. Using the last bit of his strength, Tomoya punches in the title for the game ÅESaenai Heroine no Sodatekata (Tentative Title).</p><hr>
<p>&emsp;On the meeting day, Tomoya stops Megumi before she can leave. She tries to find an excuse, but he reminds her that he did ask her in the message to contact him if she had other things to do on the day. Megumi gives him a slightly begrudged look, but Tomoya knows that he has to be a little forceful.
Taking Megumi to the broadcasting room, a grim-looking Tomoya asks her to seat herself and shuts the door behind them. Seeing that the usually impassive Megumi is frightened, he apologizes for locking the door and thinks that he hasn't noticed what he doing can seems a little wrong. He notes that Megumi's reactions are really cute (moe~).<br>
&emsp;Tomoya shows Megumi the game proposal and explains that the aim is to create a heroine that will seriously make people fall in love with her. Tomoya admits that cherry blessing is closer to Utaha and Eriri's game rather than what he's originally envisioned. That's why with the new project, he wants to take blessing software back to its roots and make a normal moege. He says Megumi's real charm will capture players' hearts. She asks him if she's going to be the main heroine again and Tomoya declares that his main heroine is and will always be Megumi alone. Megumi is a little dumbfounded.<br>
&emsp;Moving onto the topic of the staff, Tomoya says Utaha will be busy with her studies and light novels so he's put her in charge of just the main route. Eriri isn't in a good shape so he will try to find a new member to help out. Megumi asks him if he's capable of handling all sub routes by himself and if he could find someone as good as Eriri. Tomoya hesitantly says he will try his best but confesses that he has no confidence when Megumi asks him if everything's really okay. Tomoya says that's why Megumi's role is more important than ever before. Like something disastrous is about to fall upon her, Megumi makes a face. Tomoya points to the top of the staff list that has both of them down as planners. He tells her that he's serious about this and has promoted Megumi to the position of the vice president ÅEset up in a way so she has even more authority than Tomoya himself ÅEof their circle. He pleads with her to keep the &emsp;circle going together, to become his main heroine again, to support him and all sorts of other things.<br>
&emsp;Awkward silences follow. Megumi asks Tomoya if he's told Eriri about making her the main heroine. Tomoya says Eriri doesn't know yet and Megumi wonders if it's really okay to make such decisions without informing Eriri. Megumi's reaction gives Tomoya an idea. Hoping to clear his own doubts and better understand Megumi, Tomoya boldly asks her if she's angry at him because he and Eriri have gotten really close and all that.<br>
"............................................................................................................What are you saying, Aki-kun?"<br>
Hearing Megumi's indifferent, albeit delayed, reply, Tomoya knows that she really doesn't have any romantic feeling towards him. Somewhat relieved, he tries his best to play it off. Having cleared up his own doubts, Tomoya earnestly apologizes to Megumi, who tells him it'd be for the best if both of them could forget about what has happened here.<br>
"No, I'm not talking about what just happened. I'm apologizing for what happened last year."<br>
"Last year...?"<br>
"The real reason that Kato is still mad at me. I'm sorry."<br>
"Ah..."<br>
"Sorry."<br>
"..."<br>
"Sorry for not talking over things with you. Sorry for not trusting you."<br>
"Sorry for being a failure of a friend."<br>
"Sorry for making the wrong choice, for both you and Eriri."<br>
"Also...sorry for apologizing so late."<br>
"And, thank you..."<br>
"Eh...?"<br>
"Kato, you really, really liked our circle, didn't you?!" <br>
"óóóuh!"<br>
At that instant, Megumi looks up at the blank ceiling and tries desperately to contain herself.<br>
"Thank you..."<br>
"What, what are you...what are you saying..."<br></p>
<div id="div3"><a href="Illust_v07/Saekano_07_02.jpg"><img src="Illust_v07/Saekano_07_02.jpg"></a></div><p>
&emsp;Even as she tries her best to hold back tears, for the first time, Megumi's signature indifference has completely vanished.
After Megumi regains her composure, she grabs the broadcasting microphone and lets out the feelings she's been holding in all this time. Tomoya can feel Megumi's anger and sorrow as her voice echoes in the room. She lectures him on how friends should treat each other, and says that she's enjoyed her time in the circle more than she'd imagined and more than all the times she'd spent with her regular friends. She also complains about the Saenai Heroine bit of the game title. Tomoya says they can change it if she doesn't like it, though he thinks it's a pretty charming title.<br>
Seeing that it's getting dark, Tomoya half-jokingly asks Megumi to come over to his place and continue their discussion. Unexpectedly, she immediately agrees and the two find themselves in Tomoya's room having a love consultation session for him. Megumi seems to have gotten Tomoya to admit that Eriri is his first love. She asks him if he's going to confess to Utaha, who graduates the next day. Tomoya says Megumi's questions are getting too much for him and asserts that he admires Utaha (as a writer).<br>
</p>
<div id="div4"><a href="Illust_v07/Saekano_07_03.jpg"><img src="Illust_v07/Saekano_07_03.jpg"></a></div><p>
&emsp;They discuss briefly about the future of their circle. Tomoya notices that Megumi has never actually thought about leaving blessing software. She gives him a Black Thunder chocolate bar that she's bought earlier. It's still February after all. Megumi tells Tomoya to forget all about how she's behaved today. He says he will and asks Megumi to trust him. Of course, Tomoya knows that though she will return to her usual, indifferent self the next day as if a spell had been lifted, he will never be able to forget this troublesome (cute) Megumi before him right now.</p>
<hr><p>
&emsp;On graduation day, Tomoya goes on a nostalgia trip and visits every place in the school where Utaha used to frequent. An hour later, he goes to the school fields and finds Utaha alone in a crowd of celebrating students. Utaha asks him why he is not wearing his school uniform since she's planned to take all his buttons. She says she's actually surprised that he'd come to her graduation after what happened the other night. Tomoya says he has decided that he will continue blessing software and asks Utaha to give him a chance.<br>
&emsp;Inside a log house cafe, Tomoya shows Utaha the second edition of his proposal. He says that he really wants her to be a part of the project, and the proposal is written with that very intention. Utaha reads through it and gives Tomoya 75 points, which is a huge improvement for him. She points out a number of the problems with the proposal and gives him some valuable advices. Utaha tells him that with the current number of members, it will likely take a year to complete the game. Tomoya says he will take care of things, though Utaha reminds him that he will be a third year student soon.<br>
&emsp;Tomoya asks Utaha if she will join their project and says that it's fine even if she just supervises the script. Utaha doesn't give him a straight answer and instead asks him if Eriri knows about the project.<br>
"...Have you told Sawamura-san about this?"<br>
"Eriri?"<br>
"Her name is on the staff list right? What did she say about the project?"<br>
"Well...I was planning to tell her after this."<br>
"I see..."<br>
"Ah, are you worried about Eriri's slump? It's like what I wrote in the proposal, I've thought about a few different backups..."<br>
"I see...so I have to do it."
"Eh?"<br>
"I have no choice but to say it...that's just mean, Sawamura-san."<br>
"Utaha-senpai...?"<br>
"Sorry, Tomoya-kun...but I can't come with you."<br>
&emsp;Utaha tells Tomoya that she doesn't have the leisure to help him out. She says that creators need to be pushed in order to grow, and Tomoya, who is simply incapable of doing that, is unfit to be a producer. Tomoya asks her if she's met an unreasonable producer who'd push others so hard. Utaha confirms that she indeed has, and the first thing the producer said was telling Utaha to die. Tomoya wonders what kind of professionals would say things like that, but suddenly remembers a certain someone Iori has warned him about. Utaha takes a game proposal out of her bag and shows it to Tomoya.
Fields Chronicle New (Tentative Title) Proposal (First Edition) 20XX/02 Akane Kousaka<br>
&emsp;Seeing Akane's name, Tomoya knows his suspicion is correct. What surprises him though, is the name Fields Chronicle, a classic RPG series developed by a prominent game company called Mars. Reading through the proposal, Tomoya can tell the sheer level of creative difference between him and Akane, and he feels particularly captivated by the vivid illustrations. Utaha asks him which proposal he would choose between his and Akane's. Tomoya doesn't answer but he knows that his just doesn't measure up. Utaha says Akane was already onto her during the Winter Comiket. Akane was somehow able to get a copy of cherry blessing even before Comiket and thought highly of it. Utaha says she wasn't going to accept Akane's offer originally and tells Tomoya that Akane is really crazy.<br>
&emsp;Utaha apologizes to Tomoya again. He notices that she's stopped calling him Rinri-kun. He wants to ask her why she'd leave if she wished to collaborate with Eriri again and create a game that would surpass cherry blessing. As if she had read his mind, Utaha apologizes once more in a crying voice.<br>
"...Sorry, Tomoya-kun."<br>
"What we're about to talk about, is probably, my biggest betrayal."<br>
"...Eh?"<br>
"The person Akane Kousaka was most interested in...wasn't me."</p>

"...Sorry."<br>
"What the hell is this..."<br>
"Forgive me, Tomoya-kun."<br>
"It's only natural that you feel I broke the unspoken rule of the industry."<br>
"Tomoya-kun...it's normal that you'd hate me."
"But even so, I still want to team up with Eri Kashiwagi again..."<br>
"You're kidding me..."<br>
"You've got to be kidding me..." <br>
In a daze, Tomoya takes out his phone and calls Eriri, but all he can hear on the other end is her tearful apologies.<br>
"Sorry..."<br>
"Sorry, Tomoya..."<br>

<p>Text messages and flashbacks.<br>
In Eriri's messages, she asks Tomoya not to blame Utaha. Utaha wanted to save Eriri's future as an artist, so she introduced Eriri to Akane. Utaha went with Eriri too because she wanted to protect the artist as Eriri isn't professionally experienced like Utaha. Eriri tells Tomoya that Akane was very rude when they first met ÅEdenying her slump and mocking her drawings. Eriri says it was the first time she'd met such a childish adult. Akane's words however, awoke something inside Eriri. Although she's not sure if she could win against a monster like Akane, Eriri didn't want to lose to herself. By the time she had noticed, she was drawing again and managed to not only break out of her slump, but also produce her best piece of work yet.<br>
Utaha says Tomoya probably thinks it's okay to keep Eriri by his side even if she gave up on drawing, and if he had gone and tried to stop Eriri now, she would most likely listen to him. However, Utaha believes that is not the future Eriri longs for and that is not the Eriri Tomoya truly desires. Utaha says she wants to see Eri Kashiwagi's art, she wants to see Eri improve and reach the top, and if she could shine alongside Eriri, even just for a little, and help Eriri, there would be nothing more that could make her happier as a writer.</p>

I can't draw when I'm beside Tomoya.<br>
Tomoya won't force me to draw either.<br>
If I stayed in the circle any longer, it'd be the end for both of us.<br>
I can't stand that.<br>
I'm not me if I can't draw.<br>
I'm an otaku and a creator after all...<br>
Though I do have many other things, I'll never give up those two.<br>
Though there are other things I can't give up, I'll leave them aside for now.<br>
That time, I'd drawn something amazing. I'd experienced heaven.<br>
And, I've found out how to reach that heaven again...<br>
That's why I have to go.<br>
Sorry for leaving you again.<br>
Sorry for leaving you when we'd just become good friends again...<br>
P.S.<br>
Please pass on my apologies to Megumi.<br>
I can't apologize to her in person.<br>
I won't say that I hope we can still be friends, but please tell her that I will always think fondly of her.<br>
P.S.<br>
And, and...<br>
Goodbye, Tomoya...<br>
