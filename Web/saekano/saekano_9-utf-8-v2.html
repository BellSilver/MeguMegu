&emsp;The circle is having a meeting to discuss scheduling, though Iori is the only one on a webcam&#46; Tomoya comments on how the scheduling is tough, but Iori responds by saying rouge and rouge managed to follow the schedule&#46; Izumi butts in and says that the schedule left her group dead-tired&#46; Iori says that this is something only he and Tomoya can understand and that she, a mere artist, doesn&#39;t have a say in it&#46; They argue about the importance of their positions (by the end Izumi is comparing her and Tomoya to a seme and uke), and then Michiru enters the scene&#46; Tomoya scolds her for wearing something like that in front of a guy other than him&#46; Iori and Izumi comment on how it&#39;s a monopoly&#46; When Michiru asks what they mean by &#8220;monopoly,&#8221; Megumi shows up and explains that it&#39;s when a harem MC has all the girls, and that even after he picks a girl the rest of the harem has to yearn for him for the rest of their lives&#46; They start eating the food Megumi brought&#46; Megumi asks everyone physically in the room how they feel about the schedule, and they respond by saying that they&#39;re fine&#46; Iori comments on how it&#39;s mean to ignore him just because he said that she was troublesome, scheming, and manipulating Tomoya from behind the scenes&#46; He clarifies that they were in fact compliments and that she reminds him of Akane&#46; The room goes silent as Megumi pushes the hardware reset button&#46; She encourages everyone to take a break and eat before the food gets cold&#46; Everyone complies&#46;</p>

&emsp;Tomoya and Eriri eat lunch together and discuss anime clich?s about lunch&#46; He asks her to try and reject the scene he&#39;s imagining, which consists of the MC and heroine from the track team competing to buy a popular sandwich&#46; Eriri remarks that running down the hallway is dangerous and that you can just buy the bread at a convenience store&#46; Tomoya tries out another scenario where the MC charms the princess heroine by giving her his half-eaten bread&#46; Eriri says that would just creep her out&#46; A bit later, Tomoya asks if it&#39;s okay for her to be eating with him like this, to which she responds saying that everyone&#39;s adults now and she doesn&#39;t get bullied&#46; She adds that the biggest reason she isn&#39;t worried about eating with him is his image change and says that since he looks surprisingly good without glasses, the others don&#39;t know how to react&#46; The topic moves to being about Megumi&#46; Eriri asks why she hasn&#39;t been able to meet her yet&#46; Tomoya claims that Megumi was busy, but Eriri still seems dissatisfied with the response&#46; As lunch ends, Tomoya monologues that he didn&#39;t want Eriri to realize that the key visual she had worked so hard on was what caused this mess&#46; Later, he meets Megumi at a caf? who shows him the video Izumi recorded of them eating lunch together&#46; Tomoya remarks that Izumi should have joined them&#46; Megumi wonders if it&#39;s hard for Izumi to meet Eriri now and asks how her progress on the art is&#46; Tomoya says that he hasn&#39;t gotten anything and guesses that Eriri is the cause, though Megumi adds that Izumi herself hasn&#39;t said anything like that&#46; Tomoya says that there&#39;s no point in them opposing a company&#39;s RPG and that they should stick to their own affairs&#46; He sees a little crack in Megumi&#39;s flatness and asks if she&#39;ll eat the sandwich&#46; Megumi responds saying that she won&#39;t since it&#39;s half-eaten&#46;</p>

&emsp;Izumi comes over to Tomoya&#39;s house to play galge as research&#46; He asks if she&#39;s been worrying about anything lately and brings up what happened after seeing Eriri&#39;s new key visual&#46; Izumi says that while she was shocked, now she has lots of motivation from not wanting to lose to Eriri&#46; She goes on a tangent on how she doesn&#39;t like Eriri and how she&#39;s always ahead of her&#46; It ends with her reassuring Tomoya that she&#39;s fine and that she actually has a lot of rough sketches done, it&#39;s just that ideas keep coming and she can&#39;t finish&#46; They continue playing the game&#46; Izumi thinks Nanami, the kouhai character, is very cute, and hates Chinatsu, the childhood friend, for being annoying&#46; One of Nanami&#39;s scenes particularly moves her with her cuteness&#46; Eventually they get really sleepy from how the game uses the same scenes over and over again&#46; Tomoya tells Izumi to continue, which she does by reciting the game&#39;s lines and substituting Kenji&#39;s, the MC, name with Tomoya&#39;s&#46; After a couple lines on things like how many times they&#39;ve embraced each other, Izumi falls asleep with her head on Tomoya&#39;s lap&#46; Megumi comes over to visit&#46; Tomoya tells her how he&#39;s realized that kouhai heroines are cute no matter what dimension they&#39;re in&#46; Megumi isn&#39;t particularly interested in his realization and tells him to wake Izumi up so that they can have breakfast&#46;</p>

&emsp;Michiru comes over as Izumi and Tomoya are playing the galge&#46; Izumi comments on how Shizuru, the game&#39;s cousin character, and how terrible she is in how she suddenly transfers to the MC&#39;s school and eats up all the screentime&#46; Some time passes, and Megumi takes Izumi home&#46; Michiru wants to start working on the music for the game&#46; They play Shizuru&#39;s route to get an idea for the music&#46; She comments on how it&#39;s boring&#46; Tomoya says boring scenes are what let you truly see how cute a character is&#46; Some time passes, and they&#39;re discussing circle matters&#46; They agree that Izumi&#39;s fine and that the main problem is Megumi&#46; Tomoya explains that she didn&#39;t want Eriri or Utaha to leave and wanted the circle to continue like it always had and how it&#39;s because of that she so strongly feels she was betrayed&#46; Michiru points out that Tomoya was able to forgive them&#46; He says that, as passionate fans of them, he wanted them to become even greater, but Megumi is just a friend to them&#46; Tomoya asks Michiru for advice&#46; She replies saying that he shouldn&#39;t be involved with Eriri anymore&#46; Tomoya throws that option out because Eriri would be ruined if he did that&#46; Michiru is out of ideas but says that she does know someone else who can help him&#46; She remarks that Tomoya has grown up considering how now he cares about real girls&#39; problems&#46;</p>

&emsp;Tomoya is on the way home with Megumi and is trying to get her to find a time to meet up with Eriri&#46; He points out that it&#39;s been three months since she stopped talking with her&#46; Megumi asks how months he stopped talking with Eriri after the incident in elementary school&#46; After a long pause, Tomoya says five or six years&#46; Megumi responds saying that three months is nothing compared to that, though Tomoya says that the first six months are the worst&#46; She then comments on how well Tomoya reconciled with Eriri even after carrying those painful feelings, making up, and losing Eriri to another group&#46; Tomoya accuses her of pressing his trauma buttons, and she admits to purposely provoking him&#46; Megumi asks if he&#39;s ever felt that he couldn&#39;t forgive someone because they&#39;re best friends&#46; Tomoya admits that he has and that it&#39;s tiring&#46; Megumi agrees, and just as she&#39;s about to call him &#8220;Tomoya&#8221; they meet Iori&#46; Iori asks Tomoya to hang out with him&#46; He agrees but says that he needs to ask for Megumi&#39;s opinion&#46; Iori remarks that it&#39;s too late for that&#46; Tomoya looks around and realizes that Megumi already got on a train without him noticing&#46; The doors close and the train leaves&#46; Iori brings Tomoya to his house and tells him that Izumi has been in a slump&#46; He then tells him to go into her room and find out why&#46; Tomoya looks around a bit and comes up with the idea to organize the drawings sprawled across her room in chronological order&#46; Right as he finishes, he realizes that as time went on, Izumi&#39;s style got closer and closer to Eriri&#39;s&#46; Iori remarks that as a producer, he was fine with this since it would definitely sell, but he questions if it&#39;s what Tomoya wants for his circle&#46;</p>

&emsp;Iori and Tomoya are discussing the problems facing the circle&#46; Iori remarks all the problems originated from Eriri in that Izumi&#39;s lost sight of her own style and that Megumi&#39;s current attitude is making the circle atmosphere strained&#46; Tomoya explains that Megumi was best friends with Eriri and that the issue won&#39;t be easily resolved&#46; Iori responds saying that he still keeps in touch with members of his old group since he doesn&#39;t know when they might become useful again&#46; Tomoya says that Megumi doesn&#39;t think of friends in terms of monetary value or rewards&#46; Iori remarks that if you&#39;re not looking for a reward, there&#39;s no reason to get angry&#46; Tomoya decides to give up on getting Iori to understand&#46; Iori comes up with an idea to get the circle back on track, which is to get rid of Eriri&#46; Tomoya shoots down the idea&#46; The next scene has Tomoya walking back home&#46; It starts to rain&#46; He sees Utaha waiting for him, and she&#39;s soaking wet&#46; She promptly strangles him while venting how she waited so long for him and how he didn&#39;t show up&#46; The scene shifts to them being at Tomoya&#39;s house&#46; Utaha compliments Tomoya&#39;s cooking&#46; He responds saying that it&#39;s just instant miso soup&#46; She apologizes for borrowing his clothes and promises to buy new ones to give back&#46; When Tomoya says that she just has to wash the clothes instead of buying new ones, she says that she will never give these clothes to anyone&#46; A little later, he asks Utaha why she came, and she explains that she got a request from Michiru&#46; She tells him that the way to save the circle is to write a scenario with Eriri as the basis for one of the heroines and that it would let Megumi see who Eriri really is and get her to forgive her&#46; She also says that it might give Izumi inspiration&#46;</p>

&emsp;Tomoya makes a call to Eriri&#46; He asks if she still remembers the entrance ceremony of their elementary school&#46; Eriri doesn&#39;t quite remember&#46; Tomoya reminds her that they got into a fight where he threw a rock at her and she cried, but they eventually made up&#46; Eriri remembers that they fought because Tomoya thought she was a vampire and that they made up because Eriri&#39;s father pointed out that vampires don&#39;t walk around in broad daylight&#46; They continue to reminisce about the past&#46; Tomoya brings up the elementary school incident where their friendship was damaged&#46; Eriri says that they already made up&#46; He replies saying that while they had made up, they didn&#39;t understand each other, so now he wants to know&#46; He says that if he doesn&#39;t know why they made up, he can&#39;t tell Megumi to believe in Eriri and that everything will be alright&#46; Eriri says that she doesn&#39;t know how Tomoya felt either, to which Tomoya says that he&#39;ll tell her everything if she does too&#46;</p>

&emsp;It&#39;s morning when the call with Eriri finally ends&#46; After a short nap and breakfast, he starts writing a scenario which he calls Eriri route&#46; It starts with the MC seeing Eriri and meeting her when she calls out to him in the hallway&#46; She asks if he was with a girl at the caf? yesterday&#46; MC admits to being with Kanou&#46; The next scene Tomoya writes is the caf? scene where Eriri first meets Kanou, which is eerily similar to the real life version of it&#46; Tomoya stops when he realizes that at this rate, the heroine would be hated&#46; He&#39;s about to delete all of the text but decides that if he puts in some moe events, he could get a good balance&#46; Tomoya writes another scene where MC asks Eriri about dates&#46; She says that you should just agree with whatever the partner says and keep a smile on your face&#46; This scene is really similar to the one in volume 2 before the date with Megumi&#46; Tomoya tries to take a nap after this, but his urge to write keeps him up, so he goes back to writing&#46; The next scene he writes is basically the same as the climax of volume 3 where he argued with Eriri at the school&#46; After that, he writes the scene where Eriri and Kanou become friends, which is basically what happened in volume 4&#46;<br>
Dialog on the Tomoya&#39;s script:</p>
<table>
<td>
<center><font color="#00000">Scenario:</font></center>
<font color="#00000">
Eriri: …
<br>
MC: Hey, Eriri&#46;
<br>
Eriri: Wha, what?
<br>
MC: Are you nervous?
<br>
Eriri: U-um, u-uh…&#46;
<br>
She had already been in my room for over fifteen minutes when she answered&#46; During that time, Eriri had been sitting on the floor looking around and sipping a drink with a straw&#46; Even though the drink had long since gotten empty, she continued to sip from it&#46;
<br>
MC: I can&#39;t relax when you&#39;re acting so tense&#46; Back then, you came her countless times, right?
<br>
Eriri: Yeah, I came her countless times, &#8220;back then&#8221;…it&#39;s been eight years since I last came here&#46;
<br>
MC: Oh… Eriri: There sure are a lot of memories in this room…
<br>
Eriri was completely nervous, but she calmed a bit during our talk&#46; She looked at me&#46;
<br>
Eriri: Oh right…
<br>
She got up and started walking around the room until she finally stopped and slowly opened the closet&#46;
<br>
Eriri: Hey, MC&#46; Do you know about this?
<br>
MC: What is it?
<br>
What she showed me wasn&#39;t clothing but a little damage…no, it was…
<br>
Eriri: I made this&#46;
<br>
MC: I didn&#39;t notice…
<br>
Some scribbles&#46; Something sharp had engraved our names in hiragana&#46; There wasn&#39;t anything like an umbrella placed in the middle, it was just something one could pass off as writing practice&#46;
<br>
Eriri: Sorry about this&#46;
<br>
MC: Oh no, it&#39;s nothing…<br>
Anyway, I didn&#39;t find out about this for eight years&#46; There wasn&#39;t any reason to be mad about this&#46;<br>
Eriri: I know, as payback, you can damage something too&#46;<br>
MC: Oh no, it&#39;s fine&#46;<br>
For a childish prank as this, she came up with an equally childish way of apologizing&#46;<br>
Eriri: You don&#39;t need to hold back&#46;<br>
MC: There&#39;s a big difference between my house and your house&#46;<br>
The pillars at her house were marble&#46; Her parents would probably laugh it off, but I imagined the damage costs and knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to bear with the guilt&#46;<br>
Eriri: I didn&#39;t tell you to do it to my house, you know&#46;<br>
MC: Then what…?<br>
Just as I focused my attention on her…<br>
Eriri: I meant that you could do it on me…<br>
I heard the sound of clothes rustling&#46;<br>
At this point, Tomoya is pretty confused on what exactly he&#39;s writing since it&#39;s supposed to be an all-ages game, but he figures he&#39;ll just go along with it since he can just fix it later&#46;v
Next scene:<br>
Background: MC&#39;s room Character pictures: Further discussion needed on what they&#39;re wearing<br>
Eriri: …&#46;&#46;<br>
MC: …&#46;&#46;<br>
Eriri: Aah, we did it&#46;<br>
MC: Uh…sorry&#46;<br>
Eriri: What? Does that apology mean that you regret doing this?<br>
MC: Not a single bit&#46;<br>
Eriri: That&#39;s good&#46; I feel the same&#46;<br>
MC: Eriri…<br>
*Eriri: Ha ha, haha… * Eriri smiled&#46; Considering it was after &#8220;that&#8221; happened, it was unusually bright and gentle&#46;<br>
Eriri: Ahahaha, haha, ……&#46; MC: …Eriri?<br>
But that smile, disappeared in a second, just like a sand castle&#46;<br>
Eriri: Fufufu…ue…fu…aaaaaa!<br>
MC: …haha<br>
That change wasn&#39;t bad, neither to me or her&#46; After all, those tears washed away those eight years&#46; They reminded us of what idiots we were and made us wonder why we bothered with something so stupid&#46; Once they&#39;ve stopped flowing, we would be one step ahead, completely different from who we were before&#46;
Tomoya thinks that the scenario is way too different than the moege he was aiming for, and it&#39;s very embarrassing and filled with his delusions, but he can&#39;t help but feel for the couple&#46;<br>
Next scene:<br>
Background: Rooftop<br>
Meguri (smiling): Why…?<br>
Eriri (facing downwards): …<br>
Meguri: Why are you going? Why are you leaving me and MC?<br>
Eriri: …This has nothing to do with you&#46;<br>
Meguri: It does&#46; There&#39;s no way I have nothing to with you and MC&#46;<br>
Eriri: …<br>
Meguri: Or is it that you don&#39;t want me to be involved? That you don&#39;t want a newcomer like me to come in?<br>
Eriri (a distressed expression): That…that…
Meguri (a pained expression): In the end, I guess wasn&#39;t able to become your friend&#46;<br>
Eriri (a sad expression): Meguri…?<br>
Meguri: I couldn&#39;t be someone you could discuss anything with and share unpleasant opinions to help out or someone who could be with you no matter the circumstance and be looked back fondly upon&#46; I couldn&#39;t make such a unrefined, clumsy, yet beautiful friendship&#46;<br>
Eriri: Meguri…Meguri…I…<br>
Meguri (smiling): …Right&#46; Sorry&#46; That was me being selfish&#46; Eriri (a face of regret): Ah…<br>
Meguri: I&#39;m just pushing my ideals on you, ignoring your hopes, dreams, and future&#46;<br>
Eriri (a distressed expression): That&#39;s not it! That&#39;s not it!<br>
Meguri: Eriri…<br>
Eriri: The truth is, you&#39;re right&#46; You&#39;re completely right! It&#39;s just, just that…<br>
Meguri: Just that you have something you can&#39;t give up on…yes, it&#39;s the same for me too, Eriri&#46;<br>
Eriri: Meguri…<br>
Meguri: Our talk is over&#46; Sorry about calling you out here when you&#39;re so busy&#46;<br>
Eriri: W-wait Meguri, I…<br>
Meguri (crying as she smiles): S…<br>
Eriri: Ah…<br>
Meguri: Sorry, sorry…why, why…<br>
Eriri (crying): --------<br>
Meguri: Why did it wind up like this?<br>
Tomoya wonders why he&#39;s writing such a dramatic scene right after such a lovey-dovey one&#46; He realizes how off-course this scenario is from the moege he envisioned but figures that he&#39;s so deep in now that he might as well finish it&#46;<br>
Next scene:<br>
The sun was at the line of horizon, about to set&#46; Up until earlier, there was nothing but the sound of waves pounding the beach, but now the sound of a girl with golden hair playing in the water could be heard&#46; Her hair shining from the sun, it was as if it was a scene she had drawn&#46;<br>
MC: Was that really okay?<br>
Eriri: There was a problem?<br>
MC: Well, aren&#39;t you a bit too gung-ho for this? You might have to give up on a lot of things, you know,<br>
Right now, Eriri was with me&#46;<br>
No matter how one looked at it, that resolute decision was strange and sudden&#46;<br>
Eriri: That&#39;s not it&#46; I&#39;m doing so I don&#39;t have to give up on everything&#46; That includes my dreams, my friendship, and you, right?<br>
She gave a clear smile, like she hadn&#39;t thought about what was going to happen after this&#46;<br>
Eriri: Right&#46; This isn&#39;t a detour&#46; It&#39;s the right path&#46;<br>
MC: Though I can&#39;t see that at all&#46;<br>
Eriri: You&#39;ll see it in the future&#46; No mistaking it&#46;<br>
MC: You sure think highly of yourself&#46;<br>
Eriri: It&#39;s a bit too late to be saying that&#46;<br>
MC: …Well, it&#39;s true you were always like that since way back&#46;<br>
After being dragged around by her for more than ten years, I could do nothing but flash a bitter smile and shrug&#46;<br>
Eriri: But you like that part of me right?<br>
MC: Like I could go out with you&#46;<br>
But it was exactly like she said it was&#46;<br>
MC: Anyway, let&#39;s go already&#46; Meguri…everyone else is waiting&#46;<br>
Eriri: It&#39;s been a while&#46; I wonder if they&#39;re doing well&#46;<br>
MC: See for yourself&#46;<br>
I turned my back to her to hide my embarrassment and walked away&#46; She was going to follow me anyway&#46; That had been our fate for over ten years&#46;<br>
Eriri: Hey, MC&#46;<br>
MC: Huh?<br>
I turned my head around after hearing her call out to me&#46; She was staring at me intensely&#46; Her hair flowing, she had the biggest smile I had seen on her&#46;<br>
Eriri: I&#39;ll definitely make you go out with me&#46; For life&#46;<br>
Tomoya realizes that he still has to write the most important part, Meguri and Eriri making up, but he passes out from the sheer exhaustion of writing for days on end&#46;<br>

&emsp;Megumi wakes Tomoya up&#46; It turns out he didn&#39;t come to school that Monday&#46; He asks who told her of his absence&#46; It&#39;s silent for a little while before Tomoya realizes that it was Eriri&#46; Megumi asks Tomoya what he did during the weekend&#46; He tells her that he spent it all writing and that he wants her to read the results and feel something&#46; He says that the heroine is based on real life and that you could get a good idea of who that person is through reading it&#46;<br>
Tomoya and Katou&#39;s dialog after reading the "Eriri Route Script":<br>
&#8220;…phew&#8221;<br>
She breathed a heavy sigh after reading the epilogue of the Eriri route&#46;<br>
&#8220;A-are you done?&#8221;<br>
I asked after ten and several minutes of not speaking&#46; Thanks to my waiting, Katou didn&#39;t give any sharp reactions or anything&#46; She just nodded with an expressionless look on her face&#46;<br>
&#8220;H-how was it?&#8221;<br>
I timidly yet earnestly asked&#46; Did she feel something from my scenario? Did she see the real Eriri? Did she rethink mending her friendship?<br>
&#8220;…yeah, I got it&#46;&#8221;<br>
She stared at me and nodded&#46;<br>
&#8220;Katou, you got it!?&#8221;<br>
It finally reached&#46; Eriri&#39;s earnest feelings hidden behind her contrarian personality finally reached Katou&#46; Their antagonism that had lasted for three months would finally go…<br>
&#8220;I didn&#39;t get Eriri…but now I really, really get you, Aki-kun&#46; &#8220;…Katou?&#8221;<br>
Just when it was about time for a really emotional moment…<br>
&#8220;Just how much do you love Eriri, Aki-kun?&#8221; &#8220;Whhaaaaaaaaaaaaatt?&#8221;<br>
Without breaking her flatness even a bit, Katou stared at me with wide-open eyes, as if she was looking down on me&#46;<br>
&#8220;Right, if you love someone this much, of course you&#39;d forgive them no matter how many times they betray you&#46;&#8221; &#8220;No no no wait a second! Katou, did you read the whole thing?&#8221;<br>
She talked about my scenario dismissively&#46;<br>
&#8220;Yeah, I read every nook and cranny&#46; This is just a love letter from Aki-kun to Eriri&#46;"<br>
&#8220;No no no what&#39;s with that interpretation? Also no one says &#8220;love letters&#8221; anyway!&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Yes yes, that&#39;s totally what&#39;s going on here&#46; ~Understood~&#46;&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Hey! Your reaction is more dismissive than usual!&#8221;<br>
&#8220;But, you know, this is so obvious…it&#39;s worthy of being called a liar six times&#46;&#8221;<br>
&#8220;That far!?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Ah~, now there&#39;s a bunch of things I have to think about&#46;&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Like what!?&#8221;<br>
&emsp;Later, Iori and Izumi also read the scenario, with similar reactions to Megumi&#39;s&#46; Tomoya insists that they are confusing reality with fiction too much, though no one seems very convinced&#46; Izumi comments on how the game is too different from the moege she expected and how she can&#39;t draw well for this, but Iori tells her to focus solely on cuteness to get the game back on track&#46; Izumi gets motivated and swears to protect Tomoya from Eriri&#46; Iori admits that while he didn&#39;t expect the game to be like this, he enjoyed it and that he looks forward to his future scenarios&#46; Later, after Iori and Izumi have left, Megumi tells Tomoya that she&#39;ll apologize to Eriri directly&#46; She says that she&#39;ll write down what happens during their make-up so that the story between Meguri and Eriri can be finished&#46;</p><br>

&emsp;Tomoya realizes that the scenario actually reached Megumi, and she even understood that the story was incomplete&#46; Megumi comments on how she&#39;s hungry&#46; Tomoya tells her to get something downstairs, but instead she takes Tomoya&#39;s half-eaten bread and finally calls him &#8220;Tomoya-kun&#46;&#8221; She admits to enjoying his scenario and tells him that she&#39;s looking forward to the main heroine&#39;s scenario&#46;</p>
