<p>&emsp;Izumi is worried on how to compete with Eriri now that she’s seen her new key visual. Michiru reassures her by saying that there are bands out there who lost their main vocalist and still had many fans. Izumi isn’t convinced, and they quibble a bit more. They ask Megumi for her opinion, but she wasn’t paying attention as she had noticed Eriri and Utaha on the other side of the train station. Eriri is worried about how the circle reacted to her new key visual. Utaha says that she should be focusing on Fields Chronicle instead. Eriri says that worrying about others is a necessary basic social skill and that Utaha, who has no social skills, wouldn’t understand. Utaha retorts saying Eriri is no better since she’s ruined many of her relationships but also says she’ll support Eriri in making up anyway. She pats Eriri’s head, leaving her embarrassed. Megumi watches the whole scene with a pained expression.</p>

<a name="chap1"><h1>Chapter 1:</h1></a>
<p>&emsp;Michiru buys a new guitar. On the way back home she meets Utaha and drags her to a restaurant to eat curry. Michiru golfs down her curry and asks if she can eat Utaha’s as she hasn’t eaten hers at all. Utaha lets her take the curry, saying that the way she wolfed down her food made her loose her habitat. She then asks why Michiru never gets fat even though she eats so much, and Michiru replies asking why Utaha’s tits are so big even though she eats so little. Utaha ignores the question and just swirls some ice in her mouth. She then asks Michiru how the circle is doing, who responds saying that they’ve finished the plot, they have a new member, Megumi’s gotten darker, and they’re all fired up. Michiru asks how Eriri is doing. Utaha says that she should ask Tomoya that and questions why she’s being treated as Eriri’s caretaker. Michiru explains that she already is and that’s why she should know just what Eriri has done to her circle.<br>
Utaha is surprised by Michiru’s thoughtfulness and remarks that she had always thought of Michiru as the type who wasn’t considerate of other people. Michiru responds that she’s right on that, but Tomoya is family, not some stranger. She says that she doesn’t mind Utaha and Eriri’s leaving but does mind how they’re still interfering with the circle. When Utaha questions why she’s saying all this, Michiru says that Tomoya is her subordinate and she won’t forgive her if she hurts him. Utaha says that Tomoya is her kouhai. Michiru says that “kouhai” feels more distant than “subordinate”, but Utaha replies saying “kouhai” has more love in it. Michiru remarks that however the hierarchy goes, it’s exciting when the time comes, Tomoya gets stronger and reverses the relationship like the time she got lost in the mountains. This remark works Utaha into a frenzy where she Michiru if she dreams of a scenario where Tomoya pushes her down, spreads her legs wide open, and plunges his thing into her, to which Michiru notices that Utaha has gotten more vulgar since she’s entered college. This gets Utaha hungry, so she takes back the curry she gave to Michiru and eats what’s left of it.<br>
Utaha says that she’s irritated by Michiru’s status as Tomoya’s childhood friend. Michiru says that she has no problem with Eriri, to which Utaha responds saying she’s easy to manipulate. She then says that leaving Michiru with Tomoya is dangerous. Michiru clarifies that they’re family, but Utaha just calls her na?ve. She talks about a scenario where two cousins visit each other every summer to play. One summer came with only two things changed, that the girl had become beautiful and that the boy had reached puberty. During one of the nights, their parents had left the house to do shopping after the two had fallen asleep. When the boy woke up, he found the girl next to him, and she whispered into his ear if he had ever done it before. Though the girl had only meant for a kiss, right after that the boy had plunged his hand into her tank top to grope her breasts, and before they knew it the boy was using his finger to guide his thing into the girl. Michiru, her face red, breathing ragged, and had been licking her dry lips, finally snapped and told Utaha to stop. Utaha asks if Michiru really doesn’t think of Tomoya as a man. When she reaffirms that they are family, Utaha says that there’s no way that’s all there is to it considering how often their bodies come into close contact. She asks how Michiru would react if he became Unethical-kun and asked for sex. Michiru says that will never happen, but Utaha continues to ask what if. Michiru doesn’t know how to respond, saying that if she continues to think about that kind of stuff, she won’t be able to act normally around Tomoya.  Utaha points out how she constantly plays pro wrestling with Tomoya and asks Michiru if she properly holds back during those times. Michiru asks for clarification, and Utaha asks if she just holds back on power or also chooses her moves carefully. She plays a pro wrestling video for Michiru to see, and then she plays a porno with the sound on and asks Michiru if she has any memory of doing something similar with Tomoya. Michiru is unable to deny it while Utaha plays more pornos for further reference. She eventually lets out a scream, which Utaha uses to confirm her victory in this “battle.” Utaha asks if Michiru she knows what she should do from now on, to which she says that she needs to prepare herself properly before pro wrestling with Tomoya. Utaha is shocked and tells her that she should stop with the excessive skinship, but Michiru says that’s impossible because they’re family. After they leave the restaurant, Michiru and Utaha exchange phone numbers, and Michiru tells Utaha that she has a duty to help the circle and she’ll definitely make her do it.</p>

<p>&emsp;Machida and Akane meet at a bar for a drink to discuss Utaha, who is working with Machida for Pure Love Hectopascal and Akane for Fields Chronicles XIII. Akane needs Utaha for the rest of the year while Machida wants Utaha to publish one more volume this year and another one at the beginning of next year. Akane says that at the rate things are going, she’ll have to push Utaha until she burns out to make it in time. Machida is furious and tells her that’s the equivalent of dying as a creator, but Akane just says that a rest for half a year heals seventy percent of all artists who go through that. She adds that if she doesn’t want Utaha to go through that, Machida should delay Pure Love Hectopascal, and that if the game is delayed, there’ll be a massive fine. Machida is disgusted by the amount of pressure Akane puts on her employees.<br>
Akane promises she’ll give Utaha back by next year, but Machida notices how she implies she’ll be keeping Kashiwagi Eri and infers that she values her much higher than she does Utaha. Machida refuses to accept that and tells Akane she’ll regret letting go of Utaha. She adds that Utaha will go far higher than where she is right now. Akane remarks that’ll mean Machida will lose control of her too, to which she says that she doesn’t mind. She says that she wants Utaha to be happy and to at least view her as an older sister. Eventually, they decide to leave.</p>

<p>&emsp;Michiru has to do make-up exams, so now the band can’t practice together. They decide to drag her somewhere for an all-night study session but can’t decide on the place. They have a tight schedule, so they consider consulting Iori, but they reject that idea because he wouldn’t know what to do either even though he was the one who made their schedule so tight in the first place. Since Iori is mainly using Icy Tail to promote the circle, they’re unsure if they should work so hard just for them. In the end, the band decides to continue with this and stick with Michiru, even if that ultimately means picking a fight with Fields Chronicle. As they leave for home, they ponder how they’ll get Michiru to study. Echika proposes buying rope and tying her to the desk. Ranko tells her to go and buy some because her house doesn’t have any.</p>
<hr>
<a name="chap4"><h1>Chapter 4:</h1></a>
<p>“Bye. We’ll see each other again tomorrow, but this time at school.”<br>
“It’s late. You could just stay over at my place.”<br>
“No thanks. There wouldn’t be much to do, and it’s a weekday after all.”<br>
It was the last Monday of May, eleven o’ clock at night. They had just finished one of the scenarios of the circle’s second project, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata (temporary name), so it was a day worth remembering.
“Ah, wait just a bit Ka…Megumi, I’ll walk you to the train station.”<br>
“Oh no, it’s fine. Uh, what else do you say here again…was it something like ‘it’d be embarrassing if your friends gossiped about this’?”<br>
“What’s with that reaction!? Our friendship level should have risen just a few moments ago!”<br>
Tomoya was at the doorway of his house, troubled. He had just gone from calling her Katou to Megumi, and yet, there was still resentment in his voice towards her cold, unchanging treatment of him.<br>
“Well then, bye.”<br>
“…be careful, will you?”<br>
Unconsciously, or perhaps consciously, Megumi treated him in her usual flat way. She quickly exited the house and made her way to the street. Tomoya’s house was somewhere a little high, but the walk from there to the nearest train station required going down a steep hill and walking for a few minutes. Megumi went to the left, walked towards the hill…<br>
“Ah…”<br>
And casually, or perhaps forcefully, she turned around and looked at the slope above her. To be more precise, she looked at the big fancy mansion there.<br>
“I’m going to go apologize to Eriri. Directly.”<br>
That was where the person she had promised to Tomoya that she would apologize to was. At the beginning of March, they had a small…no, big disagreement and stopped talking each. That person was her former best friend, Eriri.<br>
“I have to protect that promise.”<br>
Megumi pulled out her phone and started to quickly type, her hands familiar with her phone’s screen. Of course, she didn’t do this while walking. In the past, she did, but some weird otaku obsessed with rules had started going around. Megumi eventually got fed up with listening to his stupid lectures, and the result was that even if no one was around, she followed the rules. The child-like face of that super ethical…since that expression came from a certain senpai, Megumi ignored that part, came to her mind, but with those glasses gone, she didn’t know how she should picture him. As she was thinking of all that, Megumi’s fingers were smoothly typing out the message.<br>
“Done…”<br>
Now, all she had to do was press “send.” It was a simple message, but Megumi was frozen in place.<br>
<table>

From: Megumi<br>

To: Eriri<br>

Subject: It’s been a while<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
It’s me. Good work. I saw your new key visual. I can’t give any impressions like an otaku, no, a pro can, but I thought it was great. It’s too good, to the point where I don’t know what to think. Ah, and I heard from Tomoya-kun that you wanted to talk to me. Yeah, I also want to talk. No, more like I have the resolve to do it now. Let’s meet and talk a lot, maybe about things up until now or things farther off, a bunch of things. Can you make some time for the weekend? Saturday, Sunday, both are good. I’ll be waiting for your response.<br>
</font>
</td>
</table>
Megumi looked at the message she had written almost unconsciously. She felt an unease she just couldn’t get rid of and frowned. “It’s too good, to the point where I don’t know what to think” wasn’t a lie, but it felt like she was hiding her true feelings. “Tomoya-kun”…if she said it now, it might ruin the opportunity she had finally gotten. “I have the resolve”…she didn’t like how it put all the responsibility for months of not talking on Eriri. “talk a lot” or “I’ll be waiting”…after abandoning her and not talking for two months, what’s with the friendly act? Would “I’d like to talk” or “I will be waiting” or some other more polite way of saying it be better?<br>
“Hmmm…”<br>
Normally, Megumi wouldn’t worry about these trivial things, but she was puzzling endlessly now. Her walking had led her to a dead end.<br>
Though the day she cried in front of Eriri, acted unreasonably, broke the friendship on her end, and just ran off seemed quite far now, if she thought back, she could remember every word and  every emotion. She wondered why. Even now, Megumi thought she wasn’t at fault for breaking the friendship, but the guilt she had carried since that day had grown bigger to the point it felt like it would explode. In the end, she couldn’t come up with any words to write. And inside, Megumi felt cowardly. Maybe, for just one more time, she should ask Tomoya for help…<br>
“No, that’s out of the question.”<br>
If she did such a retreat, then the promise she made would lose all meaning. She had sword to apologize…no, reconcile on her own will and her own words. Megumi continued to hesitate, to write and erase, erase and write.<br>
“…ah.”<br>
Megumi stared at her phone’s screen as if she had realized something. Determination welled up, and she nodded. Megumi stopped typing and went to her address book. Calling and using her voice to tell how she felt was best after all…<br>
“Sorry, I missed the last train, so can I stay over? …Tomoya-kun.”<br>

<p>&emsp;Izumi is selling doujin at an event. She meets a girl from a stand next to hers after the girl gets an angry customer to leave by saying her brother isn’t there and there are no more books. The girl looks at Izumi’s drawings and is amazed at how cute they are, saying they’re the cutest of all the ones in the event. However, Izumi can’t accept her praise and explains that she’s in a slump from copying a certain artist’s artstyle. The girl says it’s natural to be influenced by other people’s art. Izumi says she wants to beat that artist and find her own artstyle, so she asks for the girl’s impression. She says the art isn’t perfect and that it was definitely influenced by someone, but the influence wasn’t from that artist but from the game Izumi was working on. The girl goes on to tell a story of when she did novel illustrations. At first, people said that the art was just cute and didn’t match the writing. It was only later on that she realized she had to work to be influenced by the story and make it many times more interesting, though she doesn’t remember who or what made her realize that. The girl tells Izumi she doesn’t need to change anything and that she already can draw beautiful pictures. She feels happy and satisfied at meeting such a great artist, but she then also feels a pang of jealousy and frustration.<br>
The scene shifts to Izumi and Iori riding the train together.  Izumi is reading a book from cutie fake, the circle that was next to theirs at the event, whose author is Sagano Fumio. She’s amazed at how good the artist and thinks the book has the best art of all those from the event. Iori mentions that Sagano is a great artist and that if he was at rouge en rouge he would’ve tried to get her. Izumi replies that Utaha would kill him if he did that since Sagano is the artist of Pure Love Hectopascal. Iori remarks how surprising it is that Sagano Fumio, a male college student who doesn’t look like an otaku at all, is the artist. Izumi says that you can’t judge ability from appearances. However, Izumi shares Iori’s feeling of unease and wonders just who Sagano Fumio really is. She looks at the sky and wishes she could meet that girl again, feeling thankful, moved, and finally jealous.</p>

<p>Megumi and Eriri are on a train ride for a trip. The mood awkward and silent, so Megumi asks Eriri to talk about something. Eriri says that she doesn’t want to because Megumi is scary when she’s mad. A long silence passes before Megumi tells her she’s not mad, but Eriri just says that’s exactly why she’s scary. In truth, Megumi was mad, but she was mad at Tomoya for painting her in a negative light. Eriri tells Megumi to start the conversation instead.<br>
“Well then, I’ll start, but let me think a bit on where to start from.”<br>
Megumi worked up her courage and looked at the sky for a while. She had so many things to say that it looked like they would spill out, but she took the time to pick the one that was comparatively the most gentle before talking.<br>
“I definitely did get angry at you for no reason.”<br>
“Megumi…”<br>
“Without thinking about how things were for you, I selfishly made up my mind, treated you like a villain, scolded you, cried, and broke off our friendship…”<br>
She had a bitter smile of depreciation as she rejected those hard two months.<br>
“Thinking back on it, I’m the worst, aren’t I?”<br>
“That’s not true, you’re not unreasonable at all…”<br>
Eriri felt a drilling pain in her. Those words were so kind and gentle and yet had the opposite effect.<br>
“I’m completely in the wrong here. Everyone understand that.”<br>
After all, Eriri came prepared to be yelled at, but she wasn’t ready for Megumi to blame herself.<br>
“But Eriri just wanted to do her best and grow as a creator.”<br>
Megumi didn’t notice Eriri’s pain and kept on hurting herself and Eriri.<br>
“Envying you when you’re giving it your best or feeling betrayed, as a creator, that’s just wrong.”<br>
“Megumi stop! Blaming yourself like that…”<br>
“No, I’m in the wrong here…but only if I were a creator, anyway.”<br>
“…huh?”<br>
Megumi’s words of depreciation were just the beginning of a grand counterattack.<br>
“I’m not a creator. I’m just a normal girl.”<br>
“Megumi?”<br>
“I have no talent nor motivation to work hard. Supporting and encouraging is the best I can do.”<br>
“Uh, um?”<br>
“That’s why after you suddenly left the circle, dragged Kasumigaoka-senpai into this, and betrayed Tomoya-kun, I couldn’t forgive you. Even now I can’t do it.”<br>
“Wha-?”<br>
“To top it off, you act like you feel sorry, but in the end you’re the only one getting better. You chose to leave us and go on your path.”<br>
“Me-Megumi, calm down…please?”<br>
“What’s with that game’s key visual? If Tomoya-kun and I saw that, of course we’d be speechless.”<br>
“I don’t get it, I gave it my all to draw that to make you happy and that’s what you think of it!?”<br>
“That’s impossible. We can’t both do our best. I can’t keep up. You don’t understand…aah, just thinking back on it makes me want to cry…”<br>
“Hey, wait a minute. Megumi, you’ve definitely been calling him Tomoya-kun for a while now!”<br>
“…..no, I haven’t, you’re just imagining things Eriri.”<br>
It was the worst trip possible.<br>
They arrive at the mountains they went to in episode 0, but it’s rainy, so they can’t do anything. Megumi is sad that their trip might be meaningless, but Eriri tries to change that by using the area as a basis for a drawing for her game. Eriri gives Megumi her umbrella to hold for her and starts drawing. She makes something great, but Eriri’s creator mode only makes Megumi feels isolated from her.<br>
“…”<br>
“…”<br>
In the end, Eriri’s sketch took more than four hours. When they got to the lodge, the sun was completely gone.<br>
“U-um, Megumi…”<br>
“Hm?”<br>
“This is delicious.”<br>
“It sure is.”<br>
“…”<br>
“…”<br>
“A-and the open air bath felt really good…but the rain outside was cold, so I went from the washing place to the bathplace a couple times.”<br>
“I see.”<br>
“You should go to the bath after dinner. If you don’t you might catch a cold.”<br>
“Yeah, I’ll do that…after I’ve calmed down a bit.”<br>
“…”<br>
“…”<br>
Eriri had asked Megumi earlier to go to the bath and warm up with her, but she just said that she was tired and for her to go on ahead. During dinner, Eriri asked again, and Megumi absentmindedl responded with the same words and tired expression.<br>
“…”<br>
“…”<br>
The conversation was at a standstill, the chopsticks weren’t moving, and the mood was cold. Things had just gotten worse, and from this Eriri learned how the Narita couple* must have felt after their divorce. (*TL note – the Narita couple refers to a couple that broke up at the airport as soon as their honeymoon was over).<br>
“…Megumi!”<br>
“Hm? What is it, Eriri?”<br>
That’s why three minutes had already passed after the hot pot started boiling and yet neither had taken a bite.<br>
“If I’ve done something wrong, I’ll fix it! If I fail, I’ll just try again!”<br>
“Uh…”<br>
“So, say it already…what did I do wrong?”<br>
“You aren’t really at fault for anything here. I truly am tired.”<br>
“Did I hurt you again? Did I make you sad?”<br>
“…”<br>
Megumi didn’t meet Eriri’s gaze. As if nothing had happened, she waited for things to blow over, but Eriri wasn’t going to let that happen.<br>
“Was it dragging you around in the rain? Focusing all my attention on drawing?”<br>
“None of that was wrong, you’re fine.”<br>
“If that’s the case, then it’s something I have to figure out from the mood, but unfortunately I’m not good at that sort of thing.”<br>
“That…”<br>
That was a fault Eriri had carried since eight, maybe nine years ago.<br>
“That’s not it, that’s not it…you did the right thing.”<br>
It was why Eriri couldn’t make true friends for so long and focuses solely on drawing.<br>
“You tried to cover for my failure and give some meaning to this trip.”<br>
“Then why are you so depressed?”<br>
“…you’re not the reason for that. It’s just self-loathing.”<br>
“And that’s because…?”<br>
“Earlier, when you were drawing, I thought ‘I hate seeing Eriri go away’.”<br>
“…”<br>
And because she focused solely on drawing, she could only solve things by drawing. She used her skill to overpower them.<br>
“Even though I promised Tomoya-kun I’d make up with you…it’s so frustrating.”<br>
The hot pot’s steam vanished and the room turned cold.<br>
“I hate how I’m such a terrible person.”<br>
Her sad, quiet voice rang through the room. A feeling of powerlessness drifted around. However, Eriri still chose to move forward and try to solve this through her own strength.<br>
“What do I need to do for us to make up?”<br>
After all, that was all Eriri could do.<br>
“You don’t need to do anything. You didn’t do anything wrong in the first place.”<br>
“I don’t care about that! Wrong, right, doesn’t matter! I’m saying that I’ll do whatever it takes for us to make up!”<br>
“…that’s impossible.”<br>
“Why!? You won’t find out if you don’t try.”<br>
“Because…the truth is, I want you to come back to the circle and make another game with me.”<br>
“Ah…”<br>
“But now, no matter how you think about it, that can’t be done. This is a big chance and you have so much weighing on you. Above all, this is something you picked after worrying and worrying. That’s why I’m against it.”<br>
And because of Eriri’s strength and pureness, her attempt self-destructed.<br>
“So we’re at a dead-end. I’m sorry.”<br>
Megumi lowered her head.<br>
“Then, I’ll never be friends with you for the rest of my life?”<br>
“Of course not…just, give me a little more time.”<br>
Their food and room got colder and colder, and air felt heavy like the rain clouds from noon.<br>
“…no.”<br>
Once again, Eriri tried to force her way through this gloomy situation.<br>
“I have to make up with you right now. I don’t want this.”<br>
Tears were streaming down her face. No matter how much she failed or was repelled, she refused to give up.<br>
“I don’t want this, I don’t want this, I don’t want this!”<br>
“Eriri…”<br>
Megumi envied that persistence. She didn’t think of it as the strength to feel hopeless.<br>
“*sniffle*”<br></p>
<div id="div6">
<br>
<a href="Illust_GS2/05.jpg"><img src="Illust_GS2/05.jpg"></a><br>
</div><p>
“Eriri, please…”<br>
“*sniffle*”<br>
Megumi gently, quietly wiped Eriri’s eyes with her handkerchief, as if to take in her strong emotions.<br>
“I’m sorry. I’m really sorry, Eriri, but this is the one thing I can’t give up.”<br>
Even though she was doing the exact opposite of that.<br>
“After all, we’re best friends, and I really like you.”<br>
“Megumi…”<br>
“So I can’t compromise on our reconciliation. I can’t smile together with you when we haven’t sold anything.”<br>
Eriri kept bawling, her tears overflowing.<br>
“Hey, Eriri…”<br>
Eriri’s constant earnestness and her strong, tender, pure, and passionate feelings moved her, and perhaps because of that, her hands continuing to press the handkerchief on Eriri’s eyes, Megumi once again tried to move forward.<br>
“Won’t you go to the bath with me?”<br>
Megumi and Eriri are taking a bath. Megumi asks Eriri why she decided to leave Tomoya. Eriri claims she never left, but Megumi says she did, or at least she hurt him. However, Eriri says that they made up. Megumi says that’s not making up but Tomoya acknowledging Eriri’s resolve and that the only reason their relationship is fine is because Tomoya believes in Eriri. Eriri asks if the real reason Megumi is mad at her and they can’t make up is because of Tomoya. Megumi denies that. Eriri asks why she’s been calling him “Tomoya-kun” but Megumi replies that she doesn’t feel like talking about it. Megumi says that there’s an order to their making up and there’s still a lot of things they have to resolve. She asks what Eriri wants to become in the future and if it was really necessary to leave the circle. Eriri replies that she wants to become number one and that if she isn’t pressured, she won’t progress. She says that the circle was too much of a paradise to her. Megumi says that the place she’s aiming for seems more like hell than heaven. Eriri says that if that’s the case, then after she reaches hell, she’ll just aim for heaven. Megumi asks what she’ll do after reaching number 1, but Eriri says there is no definite number 1 because you could be number 1 in ratings or money and there are so many genres. Eriri says that for now, her goal is to be recognized as number 1 by a select few people (furigana: the circle), to one day return to those select few people, and to become happy with them. She says it’s not a goal possible to do with Akane and that she has to go further than that. Eriri apologizes for not being able to be the person Megumi wants her to be but she swears she won’t give up on them and that she’ll become the greatest, happiest illustrator. Megumi looks and sees that Eriri is in creator mode but doesn’t feel the hate for it she felt before.<br>
Megumi and Eriri are in their futons, but none of them are asleep. Eriri asks if everything will be back to normal when they wake up tomorrow. Megumi says that there’s no way that’ll and that there are things Eriri doesn’t want back to normal anyway like her resolve to develop as an artist. She also points out how no one knows when “normal” really starts and asks if Eriri would consider nine years ago when “normal” started. Megumi further asks if she regrets the first time she betrayed Tomoya. Eriri interrupts and asks why Megumi has been calling him “Tomoya-kun.” She says it’s nothing unusual and that Eriri did it since she first met him. She then talks about how Eriri and Tomoya met after fighting and how after the elementary school incident they didn’t start talking until high school. Eriri is puzzled on how Megumi knows all this, so Megumi shows her the Eriri route. Eriri is furious until Megumi tells her the scenario is a love letter towards the heroine. Suddenly Eriri is eager to read the scenario, and by the end she is crying. Megumi reveals that the scenario isn’t actually complete and that she has to write the scene where the heroines make up. Eriri is hesitant about being used as the basis of the material, but Megumi says that she’s being uses as a basis as well and that if it’s the two of them, they should be fine. The two hug each other and work on the reconciliation scene for the rest of the night. They take the train to get back home and fall asleep.<br>
“…”<br>
“…”<br>
An hour later, though in that time nothing had happened between them.<br>
“…”<br>
“…”<br>
The Shinkansen was heading towards its destination at a good speed. The sky was like the day before, cloudy. Megumi and Eriri were sleeping, their shoulders touching.<br>
“…hey, Eriri.”<br>
“…”<br>
“Eriri?”<br>
“…”<br>
Megumi opened her eyes and looked around. She turned and gazed at Eriri.<br>
“Eriri…”<br>
Megumi caught Eriri’s weight on her shoulder. She put her head against Eriri’s and started whispering into her ear.<br>
“Don’t listen to this, alright?”<br>
This truly was her last grudge left. She was supposed to say it last night as Eriri was sleeping in her futon.<br>
“You and Utaha’s departure really hurt and angered us.”<br>
“As allies, as friends, you two were that important to us. I couldn’t believe two who cared so much for the circle, for Tomoya, could leave us like that.”<br>
“It was like our hands and our feet, no, even our brains and hearts, were taken away. You two made up almost all of Blessing Software.”<br>
“We might not be able to make a great game like we could last year. Without Kashiwagi Eri or Kasumi Utako, our circle might just be any other circle doing this for fun.”<br>
“…ahem.”<br>
“Even so, even so…we’re going to have fun and feel pain and hardship, yet also be happy, making this game.”<br>
“We might not make a big splash like you guys did. We might not even be anywhere close to as good as you guys are.”<br>
“But together with the representative of this tiny circle (furigana: Tomoya-kun), this useless vice representative (furigana: me) is going to do her best.”<br>
“No, not just us.”<br>
“Hyoudo-san’s songs are matching our game better and better. Our game probably won’t lose to yours in this part.”<br>
“And Izumi-chan is our new friend. Your always on her mind, and she’s always chasing after you. You’d better be careful so you’re not overtaken.”<br>
“Anyway, that’s basically how our circle is.”<br>
“Our circle might not be as ready as it was last year, but in terms of fun and joy, we won’t lose, you know?”<br>
“If you’re going to be the world’s happiest illustrator, then I’ll be the world’s happiest main heroine.”<br>
“…inside the game, anyway.”<br>
“And someday, if that time comes, let’s make something together.”<br>
“Like, if you really want to make something but can’t do it at work, then Blessing Software will welcome you anytime.”<br>
“Or if Tomoya-kun gets acknowledged and lands a big job…if such a dream-like day comes…we’d be happy if you two came and help.”<br>
“…thanks for not listening until the very end.”<br>
“Let’s get along from now on, Eriri. Sleep well.”<br>
Megumi was very sleepy by that point, but even so, she gave it her all to finish. Once she was done, she fell asleep. The two lay close to each other, rocked by the train.<br>
“…”<br>
“…”<br>
And then, several minutes later, when Megumi was asleep without a doubt…<br>
“Why are you assuming you’ll always be with Tomoya?”<br>
It seemed that last grudge was heard after all.<br>

<a name="epilouge"><h1>Epilogue:</h1></a><p>
Icy Tail holds a concert. The circle and Eriri and Utaha attend. Eriri asks Utaha if she’s okay with not meeting Tomoya, to which she remarks that she came for the concert, not for that. The concert is a success. Michiru thanks the crowd for their support. She talks about her experiences up until now and expresses sadness that some of the people she worked with aren’t here anymore, a reference to Eriri and Utaha. She plays the debut single of their album, titled Icy Tail Yo (Aishiteru Yo).</p>

“How is it? Is it done?”<br>
“It’s going pretty well. Thanks for helping with the reconciliation scene, Eriri.”<br>
“Hey, Megumi.”<br>
“Hm?”<br>
“Meguri and Eriri, is everything back to normal for them?”<br>
“…”<br>
“Megumi?”<br>
“Even if time passes, nothing completely goes back to normal.”<br>
“But what about things like unchanging feelings or eternal love?”<br>
“Feelings keep on changing, Eriri.”<br>
“And that means…”<br>
“Like, there’s someone who you had never felt anything towards before, but one day, that all changes.”<br>
“Ah…”<br>
“Of course, there are also times when those feelings go back to normal.”<br>
“So which is it!?”<br>
“Who knows? I can only say this.”<br>
“And that is?”<br>
“At the very least, that’s happened to me once.”<br>
“…”<br>
“What about you, Eriri?”<br>
“My feelings have never changed like that.”<br>
“But size changes, right? They get bigger and smaller…”<br>
“If that’s the case, then yeah, they’ve changed, but…”<br>
“But?”<br>
“They’ve never gotten smaller.”<br>
“…I see.”<br>
