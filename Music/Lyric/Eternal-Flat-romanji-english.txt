English Translated:
Like how we clasp our hands,
let's try connecting this dream and that dream's plugs.
I can't process this with a flat heart.
I loved and loved these thoughtless days and this unique place and was lost in them.
Let's share the password to where we keep our dreams until they come true.
We'll break the box storing the words we wanted and couldn't say.
Were these scattered, sparkling feelings really so bright?
I still won't shed any tears because I want to cry with you one day
when I'm too happy to hold them back.
Though we're as different as the plus and minus on a magnet,
I'm sure it's because we're so different that we're strong.
This isn't trivial. Do it purposely.
I didn't want this to end with me breaking character.
For now, let's empty this trash can filled with regrets.
We misunderstood, we understood, as friends we did both.
It's fine if the fluttering, beckoning future
comes with just the speed of a leaf boat.
We'll be able to reach there someday.
I wonder if I'm allowed to stay flat for now
since you're a sharp.
You're as selfish as can be, but I still want to be by your side. Why?
We're alike in how we mess up the way we express our love.
Let's share the password to where we keep our dreams until they come true.
I broke the box storing the words I wanted and couldn't say.
Though it's hard to express what you want to express, it's also important.
Hey, I like things are now
since if we're together, we can go back to where we belong.
